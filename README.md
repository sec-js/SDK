You will need an API key which you can obtain at https://intelx.io/account?tab=developer. Please note that integration into your commercial service/product requires a paid license. If your product is open source, do not embed your API key. The use of public API keys is discontinued.

## Link to intelx.io

Instead of directly using the API, you can always do the ghetto version instead and just link to the website.

```
https://intelx.io/?s=[search term]
```

Examples:

```
https://intelx.io/?s=test.com
https://intelx.io/?s=test@example.com
```

The search engine supports only the following strong selector types. Anything else will be rejected.

* Email address
* Domain, including wildcards like *.example.com
* URL
* IPv4 and IPv6
* CIDRv4 and CIDRv6
* Phone Number
* Bitcoin address
* MAC address
* IPFS Hash
* UUID
* Simhash

* Social Security Number
* IBAN
